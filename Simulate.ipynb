    "The aim of this project is to simulate a real world phenomenon that can be measured, which one hundred data points could be collected across different variables. In this case I have chosen a number of famous horse races across the world. Types of variables involved with succesful horses in these races will be investigated, such as age, weight, rating, experience etc. The likely distributions of these variables will be simulated (based on previous trends) and also their relationships with each other will be examined.  \n",
    "A dataset will then be simualted based on these variables' distributions in an attempt to predict the attributed of horses likely to be successful in these races.\n"

    "Numpy, or numerical Python, is a library used in Python to create different types of arrays or multi-dimensional matrices, and includes a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.[1]. In this case Numpy will be used to simulate data using the numpy.random package based on certain mathematical distributions.  \n",

    "Matplotlib is a plotting library used in python to create visual plots from data. [2]. For this case Matplotlib will be used to create certain plots to help present large amounts of numerical data, generated using Numpy, in a clear and concise manner using histograms, charts etc.  \n",

    "## Background\n",
    "***\n",
    "Horse racing is a widely popular sport in many countries throughout the world. The basic premise is racing horses against each other over different conditions (distances, obstacles, surfaces etc.) to determine which is the fastest. Horse racing has been performed for thousands of years throughout the world in a variety of formats. There are records of horse races in Ancient Roman and Greek literature (particulary chariot races). [3]  From the 1400s to the 1800s a horse race closed the traditional Spring festival in Rome where riderless horses, imported from Africa, were raced along the Via del Corso (a long straight street).  Subsequent to this type of horse racing, the sport gained popularity with British royalty and aristocracy, earning it the title of \"The Sport of Kings\". This title has been maintained to this day, with a certain element of \"high society\" involved in owning and managing large stables and thoroughbreds worth millions of Euro.  \n",
    "The sport also gained huge popularity with the working class, particular in terms of wagering on the outcomes of horse races. Bookmakers, or \"bookies\", will set certain odds on horses based on their perceived chances of winning, or placing (second, third, fourth etc.) and customers, or \"punters\" will place money with the bookmaker in an attempt to win money from the bookmaker based on the outcome of the races.  \n",
    "The bookmaking component is likely the main reason for the ubiquitous popularity of the sport. The prohibitive cost of owning and maintaing horses, espcially thoroughbreds used in high profile races, prevents nealry all but the wealthy elite from becoming involved as owners. However, having money on a horse in a race, and the possibility of winning money on the outcome of these races, allows any person (provided they are over the permitted gambling age of 18...) have a level of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.starsportsbet.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/starring.jpg)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The wagering element of horse racing is a big business. It is estimated that over $100 billion dollars annually is bet on horse races throughout the world.[4] The most popular horse to gamble on is the English Grand National, run at Aintree racecourse every April. Approximately £300 million is bet on this race alone each year [5] , a staggering amount.  \n",
    "There is also a prize fund given for winnning or placing (second, third, fourth etc.) to the winning owners, trainers, and jockeys. The prize fund for the English Grand National is in the region of £1 million pounds. [6]  I will discuss further details of this race, and others in subsequent sections.\n",
    "Needless to say, when there is so much money (and prestige) involved in these races, having a statistical analysis to help predict a succesful entrant could prove very lucrative."
