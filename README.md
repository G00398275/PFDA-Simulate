For this project I will be creating a dataset to simulate a real-world problem. In this case I will be simulating data based on famous horse races throughout the world in an attempt to predict likely winners of said horse races. The simulations will be based on previous historical trends in these races, and a statistical model will be created based on previous performance characteristics of successful horses (Age, Weight, Rating, Stall Draw, etc.)  Some of these variables are related, and some are independent of each other. With the aid of python code and plots I will build a simulation of these races help predict likely winning participants in the following races:  

1. The English Grand National  
2. The English Derby  
3. The Kentucky Derby  
4. The Melbourne Gold Cup  

The simulation is located in the Jupyter notebook "Simulate.ipynb" contained in this folder.
